I just had a look at the redshift cluster configuration and I could see the CPU utilization sometimes touches 90% and based on our discussion yesterday, you did mention that userbase and the data volume will grow eventually in near future. This means you might want to have a self-managed compute as well as storage solution.  I would recommend to go for RA3 node for the cluster. This is a self-managed compute and storage solution that was introduced in December of last year. 

A typical ra3.16x large node will have below properties.

1.	VPCU – 48
2.	RAM – 384 GB
3.	Slices/node – 16
4.	Storage/node – 64TB
5.	Node Range – (2-128)

Also good thing is they use high performance SSD compared to HDD in case of ds machines.

From migration standpoint also existing clusters can easily be moved to ra based cluster using the snapshots. I will continue to analyze more on this and would let you know if I find any other improvement opportunities.

Please let me know your  thoughts on this.
